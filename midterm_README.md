**Student:** Akhrorov Temurbek
**Student ID:** 12204574

## Introduction

This assignment is aimed at implementing and understanding a predictive maintenance project for conveyor belts using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The tasks involve simulating data, preprocessing it, training an LSTM model, and making predictions for maintenance.

## Task 1: Data Simulation

**Task 1.1: Generate Sequential Data**


In this task, we create realistic data by implementing the `generate_sequential_data` function. This function simulates sensor readings over time for a conveyor belt system. The generated data includes measurements for temperature, vibration, and belt speed.

**Task 1.2: Include Failure Detection**

To represent real-world scenarios, we modified the data generation function to include both failure detection and non-detection scenarios. This modification enables us to simulate situations where a failure is detected and when it is not.

**Task 1.3: Generate Datasets**

To train and test our predictive maintenance model, we generated datasets with varying numbers of sequences and sequence lengths, taking into account different failure probabilities. This allows us to experiment with various maintenance scenarios and evaluate the model's performance.

## Task 2: Data Preprocessing

**Task 2a: Preprocess Sequential Data**

For proper model training, we implemented the `preprocess_sequential_data` function. This function reshapes and preprocesses the generated data as needed to ensure it is in the appropriate format for training.

**Task 2b: Scale Data**

To standardize the data, we utilized the `StandardScaler`. This step is essential to make sure that all features have the same scale and are suitable for training.

**Task 2c: Split Data**

We split the data into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function. This division is crucial for evaluating the model's performance.

## Task 3: LSTM Model

**Task 3a: Create an LSTM Model**

We used TensorFlow and Keras to design an LSTM model. LSTMs are suitable for modeling sequences, making them an excellent choice for predictive maintenance tasks.

**Task 3b: Model Architecture**

In this task, we defined the model architecture with appropriate layers. The architecture is chosen based on the problem's nature and requirements.

**Task 3c: Compile the Model**

To prepare the model for training, we compiled it with a suitable loss function and optimizer. This step is crucial to set the model's learning objectives.

## Task 4: Model Training

**Task 4a: Train the Model**

Using the training data, we trained the LSTM model for a specific number of epochs and with a batch size. This step is critical to allow the model to learn from the data.

**Task 4b: Monitor Training**

We monitored the training process and evaluated the model's performance using the `evaluate` method. This helps us assess how well the model is learning.

## Task 5: Real-time Simulation

**Task 5a: Simulate Real-time Data**

In this task, we simulated real-time data for conveyor belts. This simulation allows us to make predictions using the trained LSTM model in a real-time setting.

**Task 5b: Predict Failures**

We implemented alerting logic to notify maintenance teams when a failure is predicted. This is achieved by setting thresholds for predictions.

## Task 6: Completing the Assignment

**Task 6a: Run the Simulation**

We ran the simulation for a specified number of iterations to evaluate the model's performance in a real-time scenario.

**Task 6b: Document Results**

We documented the results, including predictions and alerting events, as required by the assignment.

**Task 6c: Summary Report**

We created a summary report in Markdown format, explaining the project, data generation, model training, and results. This report serves as a comprehensive overview of the entire assignment.

## Additional Challenge (Optional)

As an optional challenge, we implemented a visualization component to display sensor data and predictions in real-time during the simulation, enhancing the project's user interface and data visualization.

## Submission

The entire project, including Python code for each task and the summary report, is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TimothyAv/Ai/blob/main/Mid_term_12204574.ipynb). Please refer to the repository for the complete code and detailed results.

**Deadline:** The assignment was submitted on Saturday, October 21, 2022.
